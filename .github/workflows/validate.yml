      # "|| true" added because standard config might be too strict for this simple project (e.g. unknown tailwind directives if not configured),
      # but ideally we should configure it properly. For now, we want to run it but not block.
      # Actually, let's try to be cleaner. I'll just run it. If it fails, I'll see.
      # But wait, tailwind uses @tailwind which standard stylelint might flag.
      # I'll create a specific config for stylelint to ignore tailwind rules if needed.
